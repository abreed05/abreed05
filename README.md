I'm Aaron Breeden, an IT professional with 8 years of professional IT experience ranging from help desk to sysadmin work. 

In both my professional and personal life I am a linux geek at heart and love the aspect of automation. Put simply I'm lazy and I do not like 
to do a task more than once if I can avoid it. 

My account here reflects projects that I have built bot for personal and professional use. 

Technology fascinates me and as such I am always trying to learn new things. Rather that is a new language, tool, or process. I spend more time than I should 
building out my home lab. Standing up and tearing down various services. 

Feel free to check out my public repositories for the current work I am doing.
